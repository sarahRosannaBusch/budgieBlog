        This is the very first video I took of Apollo. After three months of trust
        building, taming, and "stepping up", we moved on to "come" and "target" which
        you can see here. I was stoked to get him to fly to me on command. (Well, on
        command might be stretching it, he understands what it means, but he only does
        it when he's in the mood.)

      <p>
        Taming and training a budgie is all about building trust. During the first
        couple of weeks it is important to take it slow, and show your little bird
        that he is safe in his new home.

      <p>
        After a couple weeks of settling in, I wanted to let Apollo out of his cage to get some exercise.
        It was a bit of a gong show, but we both made it through more or less intact.

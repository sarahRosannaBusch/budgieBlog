        Welcome to my budgie blog! I'm putting this together to share some of the things I've
        learned from living with a pet bird. And to show off how cool Apollo is.
        It might be interesting to any of you
        who have parakeets, who are considering becoming an avian pet owner, or are
        just curious about what I've been up to for the last five months. (Or the
        last two years if you're interested in the techy aspects of the site.)
      </p>

        This site is still under construction, so bear with me. I've got tons of
        content that I'm currently in the process of polishing. I'm starting to
        add it now that I've got all the html, css, and javascript more or
        less completed. I've designed the site so that it should work well on
        any device, so if you find something that isn't working, or that looks weird,
        please let me know so I can fix it pronto. Thanks :)
      </p>

        In the meantime, check out my six-month old budgie Apollo
        in this little video I put together.

        Welcome to my budgie blog! I'm putting this site together to share some of the things I've
        learned from living with a pet bird. And to show off how cool Apollo is.
        It might be interesting to any of you who have parakeets, who are considering
        becoming an avian pet owner, or who just want to check out some photos and videos
        of Apollo.
      </p>

        This site is still under construction, so bear with me. I've got tons of
        content that I'm currently in the process of polishing. I'm
        adding it now that I've got all the html, css, and javascript more or
        less completed. I've designed the site so that it should work well on
        any device, so if you find something that isn't working, or that looks weird,
        please let me know so I can fix it pronto. (You can find my email address
        at the bottom of the page.) I welcome any other feedback you'd like to give
        as well.
      </p>

        Here's a short video I put together of some of the fun Apollo and I had during
        our first few months together:

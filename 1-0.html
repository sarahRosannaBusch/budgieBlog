    I had been dreaming of getting a pet for quite a while. Every time I saw
    a cute dog I thought about what it would be like to have one. Then I would
    do some Googling about what breed would be best, but it always brought me back
    to budgie. As much as I thought I wanted a dog, what I really wanted
    was an animal that I could train and play with. Dogs are great for this,
    but they require a lot of time, space, and money. And would it be ok in
    my tiny apartment all day? I had budgies when I was a kid and absolutely
    loved them. I have bookmarked tons of videos and websites that give a glipse
    of what it's like to have a pet parrot. I'll post links to them here later,
    but for now here's an example of a budgie's ability to talk.

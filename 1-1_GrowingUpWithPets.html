        I started life with a positive association towards living with animals.
        When I was very young, my mom, dad, baby sister, and I lived on a small
        farm in Miscampbell, Ontario. We had two horses named Bo and Dee, a german
        shepherd named Tessie, and I have a vague memory of having chickens at some
        point.

        Our dog was somewhat famous because she had run off one day to save the
        boy who lived a mile down the road. He had gotten himself between a momma
        bear and her cubs! For those of you who don’t already know this: baby bears
        are super cute and friendly, but going near them can get you killed. Seriously.
        Also, it is always best to have a dog with you if you are going out into
        the woods by yourself.

        Eventually my parents split up. One of the horses had died and the other
        they sold. We moved into town. Tessie got old and went out to live with
        grandpa on his farm in Pinewood. No this isn’t one of those stories your
        parents tell you when your dog dies, we went out to visit them all the time.
        She lived there until she was 16 or so, when she died of old age.

        Mom had developed allergies to dogs and cats, so we never got another furry
        animal at her house. But after my sister and I had begged enough for a new
        pet finally she broke down and took us to the pet store in Winnipeg (there
        were none closer than that). Mom had a cockatiel when she was growing up
        that she had loved so she led us towards the bird section. The girl working
        at the store showed us the budgies. She told us about how they had been
        playing with them and training them a bit. There was one in particular that
        had mastered the “step-up” command and she thought he was going to be very
        trainable and maybe even be able to talk. I loved him instantly. He was
        a blue budgie who I eventually named Blue Boy at auntie’s suggestion. My
        sister chose an all white budgie she named Snowflake. We got all the accessories
        we would need and set off for the four hour car ride home. The birds sat
        in their cage between us in the back seat. I still have this vivid memory
        of my aunt turning around in the passenger seat, and upon seeing my face
        saying, “Sarah is in love.”

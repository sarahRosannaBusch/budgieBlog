      Before getting Apollo, in February of 2016, I thought a lot about why I wanted
      a pet. In the following posts I share my thought process, as well as links to
      other blogs and sites that have important information worth considering before
      deciding to bring a budgie into your home.

    <p>
      I grew up living with animals, and animal lovers. In this section I talk a bit
      about what that was like and the pets I had.

      I had been living without a pet since I moved to Victoria in 2009. Find out
      why I decided to get one again seven years later.

      You know how everybody is obsessed with cat videos on Youtube?
      Well I happen to think the budgie ones are even better. You can watch some
      of my favourite budgie (and other kinds of parot) videos here.

    <h3 class='postTitle'><a class='blurbLink'  href='comingSoon.html'> Ethics of pet keeping </a></h2>
    <p>
      To weigh the decision of whether or not it is moral and ethical to keep a budgie
      as a pet, I went to the internet to find out about
      how budgies fair in captivity. This is what I found out.

    <p>
      After deciding that I wanted a pet, and  specifically that I wanted a budgie,
      I had to figure out where to get one. I talk about all the options I found here,
      and the pros and cons of each of them.

      This is the story of the day I brought my new baby budgie home
      to live with me, and of how he got his name.
